# SVG-Edit-react

The user interface of SVG-edit is based on vanilla javascript and the jQuery library. This editor is a demonstration of the usage of the SVG-edit "svgcanvas" with a React User Interface. It's far from being as complete as the original SVG-edit but this is a proof of concept that we may decide to use for a future version of SVGedit.

To test this, you have to clone and run:
````
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
````

you can also launch the application from the following link:
https://svg-edit.github.io/svg-edit-react/dist/index.html


All contributions/remarks are welcome (including proof of concept for Angular or Vue)
